    In-memory repository for post storage and management.
    
    This repository provides thread-safe operations for storing posts in memory.
    Each post is represented as a dictionary with id, text, and created_at fields.
    Posts are organized by user_id for efficient user-specific operations.
    
    Note:
        This is an in-memory implementation suitable for development and testing.
        In production, this should be replaced with a proper database repository.
